### Installing dependencies

Before installing <span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>, it is recommended to check [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux) (v. 3.4.4 or higher) and the following libraries to be present:

- [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org), [PROJ](https://proj4.org) and [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos)
    (required by [rgdal](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rgdal)
    and [rgeos](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rgeos));
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)
    (required by [jqr](https://github.com/ropensci/jqr));
- [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
    (required by [protolite](https://github.com/jeroen/protolite));
- [V8](https://v8.dev)
    (required by [geojsonio](https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio));
- [openssl](https://www.openssl.org)
    (required by [openssl](https://github.com/jeroen/openssl));
- [cairo](https://www.cairographics.org)
    (required by [gdtools](https://github.com/davidgohel/gdtools));
- [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl)
    (required by [curl](https://github.com/jeroen/curl));
- [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf)
    (required by [ncdf4](https://github.com/mdsumner/ncdf4));
- [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org)
    (required by [XML](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XML)).
    
Other binaries are required (or suggested), since they are used in runtime by the package:

* [**GDAL**](http://www.gdal.org) (with support for JP2OpenJPEG format):
    this is a mandatory dependency, needed for all the processing operations
    and to retrieve metadata from SAFE products;
* [**Sen2Cor**](http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/sen2cor)
    is used to perform atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 Level-1C products:
    it is required by the package, unless you choose not to correct products locally
    (using only Level-1C – TOA products or downloading directly Level-2A products).
* [**aria2**](https://aria2.github.io) is an alternative downloader which
    can be used to faster the download of SAFE archives; it can be optionally
    installed and used.

To install both package dependencies and runtime binaries (excepting **sen2cor**, which is installed by <span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>):

- On Debian and Ubuntu:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo apt-get install -y r-base gdal-bin python-gdal aria2 libpython-dev libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libjq-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libv8-dev libssl-dev libcairo2-dev
    ```
    On Debian, `proj-epsg` is also required:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo apt-get install -y proj-epsg
    ```
    On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial and 14.04 LTS Trusty, the repositories [ubuntugis](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis) and [opencpu](https://launchpad.net/~opencpu) must be added before installing the packages:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:opencpu/jq
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
    sudo apt-get update -q
    ```
    Installation was tested over Debian 9 Stretch and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic; newer versions (Ubuntu > 18.04, Debian > 9) should work, like Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial and 14.04 LTS Trusty should also do. Other releases (Debian &#8804; 8; Ubuntu non-LTS < 18.04; Ubuntu LTS &#8804; 12.04) are not supported.
- On Fedora:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo yum install R gdal gdal-python aria2 python-devels gdal-devel proj-devel geos-devel udunits2-devel jq-devel protobuf-devel v8-devel openssl-devel cairo-devel libcurl-devel netcdf-devel libxml2-devel
    ```
    Installation was tested over Fedora 29.
- On ArchLinux:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    sudo pacman -S --noconfirm r base-devel gcc-fortran python-gdal wget aria2 jq protobuf git
    cd /tmp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/gyp-git.git
    cd gyp-git; makepkg -si --noconfirm
    cd /tmp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/v8-3.14.git
    cd v8-3.14; makepkg -si --noconfirm
    cd /tmp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/udunits.git
    cd udunits; makepkg -si --noconfirm
    ```
    Installation was tested on date 2018-11-21.

### Installing <span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>

Before proceeding, it is suggested to update the existing R packages:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```
Doing that, the following warning could appear:
```
Warning in install.packages(update[instlib == l, "Package"], l, contriburl = contriburl,  :
  'lib = "/usr/lib/R/library"' is not writable
Would you like to use a personal library instead?  (y/n)
```
If so, press `y` and continue.
Moreover, if no personal libraries already exist, it is asked to create a new one: ask `y` and continue.

After that, the package can be installed from GitHub with the R package **remotes**.
To do it:

1. install the package **remotes**, if missing:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("remotes")
    ```
2. load it and install
    <span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span
    style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span
    style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(remotes)
    install_github("ranghetti/sen2r")
    ```

This will install the R package along with its package dependencies,
containing all the functions necessary to preprocess data.

Finally, **sen2cor** can be installed from R:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sen2r)
install_sen2cor()
```

### Installing <span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base) must be installed before proceeding.

In the case it was already installed, it is suggested to update the existing R packages:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

<span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span> can be installed from GitHub with the R package **remotes**.
To do it:

1. install the package **remotes**, if missing:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("remotes")
    ```
2. load it and install
    <span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span
    style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span
    style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(remotes)
    install_github("ranghetti/sen2r")
    ```

This will install the R package along with its package dependencies,
containing all the functions necessary to preprocess data.

### Installing runtime dependencies

To run the functions correctly, some external dependences are required:

* [**GDAL**](http://www.gdal.org) (with support for JP2OpenJPEG format):
    this is a mandatory dependency, needed for all the processing operations
    and to retrieve metadata from SAFE products.
    To avoid incompatibilities, starting from
    <span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span
    style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span
    style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>
    v. 1.1.0 it is _strictly mandatory_ to use
    a GDAL installation provided with the
    [OSGeo4W installer](https://qgis.org/it/site/forusers/download.html):
    if this requirement is not satisfied, it is possible to install GDAL
    with OSGeo4W directly from R (see below);
* [**Sen2Cor**](http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/sen2cor)
    is used to perform atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 Level-1C products:
    it is required by the package, unless you choose not to correct products locally
    (using only Level-1C – TOA products or downloading directly Level-2A products).
* [**aria2**](https://aria2.github.io) is an alternative downloader which
    can be used to faster the download of SAFE archives; it can be optionally
    installed and used.

These dependences can be graphically checked launching the function
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sen2r)
check_sen2r_deps()
```
This function opens a GUI which help to check that they are satisfied;
if some of them are missing, the GUI allows to install them directly.

<!-- Atmospheric correction is performed using [sen2cor](http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/sen2cor):
the package will automatically download and install it at first use,
or by running function [`install_sen2cor()`](reference/install_sen2cor.md).
Please notice that the use of sen2cor algorythm was not yet possible under MAC.

Preprocessing functions make use of [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org), which must
support JPEG2000 format. On Windows, it is strongly recommended to install it
using the [OSGeo4W installer](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe)
in advanced mode, and checking the installation of `openjpeg` library. -->

### Installing GDAL
In order to avoid incompatibilities with GDAL, starting from
<span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span
style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span
style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>
v. 1.1.0 it is _strictly mandatory_ to use
a GDAL installation provided with the
[OSGeo Homebrew repository](https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac).
To do it:

1. if Homebrew is missing on your system, install it opening a terminal and typing:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```
    (see [the Homebrew webpage](https://brew.sh/) for details);
2. install GDAL by typing:
    ```{bash, eval = FALSE}
    brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac
    brew install osgeo-gdal-python
    ```
    (see [the OSGeo Homebrew webpage](https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac) for details).
    At this step, an error could be returned in case another GDAL installation was already present;
    in this case, follow the instruction returned in the terminal to solve it
    (probably some packages must be unlinked with the instructions `brew unlink <package>`).

### Installing <span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base) must be installed before proceeding.

In the case it was already installed, it is suggested to update the existing R packages:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

Packages can be installed using the compiled binaries, except from **sp**, **sf**, **rgdal** and **rgeos**,
which are recommended to be compiled. To do it, use the command
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("sp", "sf", "rgdal", "rgeos"), type = "source")
```
__after__ having installed GDAL as described above.

<span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span> can be installed from GitHub with the R package **remotes**.
To do it:

1. install the package **remotes**, if missing:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("remotes")
    ```
2. load it and install
    <span style="color:#5793dd;vertical-align:top;font-size:90%;font-weight:normal;">sen</span><span
    style="color:#6a7077;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:115%;font-weight:bolder;">2</span><span
    style="color:#2f66d5;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:90%;font-weight:bold;">r</span>:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(remotes)
    install_github("ranghetti/sen2r")
    ```

This will install the R package along with its package dependencies,
containing all the functions necessary to preprocess data.

    and to retrieve metadata from SAFE products.
    If the previous instructions were followed, it was already installed;
* [**Sen2Cor**](http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/sen2cor)
    is used to perform atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 Level-1C products:
    it is required by the package, unless you choose not to correct products locally
